        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>My Doctor is a revolutionary healthcare service that brings medical consultations to
            your mobile or laptop device anywhere in South Africa or right to your doorstep in
            Cape Town. We understand that visiting a doctor's office can sometimes be
            inconvenient, especially for those with limited mobility or lack of transportation.
            With our virtual consults and home visit services, you can receive personalized
            medical care from the comfort and convenience of your own home.</p>

        <p> Our Mission:
            At My Doctor, our mission is to provide accessible, convenient, and compassionate
            healthcare services to all South Africans. We strive to bridge the gap between
            patients and doctors, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to receive highquality medical care,
            regardless of their circumstances.</p>
